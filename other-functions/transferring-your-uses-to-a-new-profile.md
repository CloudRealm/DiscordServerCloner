# Transferring your uses to a new profile

Since uses are paid and our user base is fairly volatile we wish to support our members by allowing redeemed uses to be transferred off your profile and onto another using a recovery key.

1. Run the `clone.backup` command in DMs, this will generate a random Globally Unique Identifier \(GUID\) that will then be used as a recovery key for your account, you should keep this somewhere safe on your device outside of discord
2. When the time comes to transfer simply run `clone.transfer` with the recovery key and the uses will be transferred over to your new account - ex. `clone.transfer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, this key should be kept safe as anyone with access to it can transfer uses to their account.
{% endhint %}
